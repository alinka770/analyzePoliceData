Done:

I received data for research. I examined the data for gaps and did an initial analysis of the data.
I analyzed the type of received data and built visual graphs for some of the data.

To do:

Analyze data by different parameters, by city of crime, by age, by category of crime. 
Add a column to the data with the distribution to which part (north, south, center) the crime belongs. 
Analyze with with and without missing values.
